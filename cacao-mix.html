			<h4>Stimulants</h4>
			<p>
				This blend offers a balanced blend of naturally occurring stimulants from cacao, matcha, and CoffeeBerry. These ingredients provide cognitive and metabolic benefits with better antioxidant effects and without the jitteriness or energy crashes typically associated with pure caffeine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cacao contains theobromine, phenylethylamine (PEA), and anandamide, which collectively improve mood, focus, and neurotransmitter balance. Cacao’s catechins and epicatechins help prolong the effects of these bioactive compounds while offering antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.
			</p>
			<p>
				Matcha is rich in polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), along with L-theanine, which synergistically enhance cognitive focus, mitigates oxidative stress, and reduces inflammation. The antioxidants in matcha also protect against neurodegeneration and support metabolic health.
			</p>
			<p>
				CoffeeBerry provides a gentle caffeine boost complemented by its polyphenols, which enhance cognitive health and antioxidant defenses.
Unlike isolated chemical stimulants, this blend incorporates bioactive compounds that work together to support neurotransmitter function, protect neurons from oxidative damage, improve metabolic health, and promote fat loss.
			</p>
