			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<p>
				Raw Cacao Powder, Salt Mix, Cordyceps Mushroom Powder, Lion's Mane Powder, Turkey Tail Powder, Chaga Powder, Turmeric Powder, Matcha Powder, Rhodiola Rosea, Ginseng Extract (10% Ginsenosides), CoffeeBerry Extract, Niacin (Vitamin B3), Green Cardamom, Clove
			</p>


			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Raw Cacao Powder (7 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Rich in flavonoids (catechins and epicatechins) that improve blood flow, supporting cardiovascular and cognitive function. 
					Contains theobromine (~84 mg) for gentle stimulation, mood enhancement, and vasodilation. 
					Phenylethylamine (~35 mg) and anandamide (~140 μg) contribute to mood elevation and neurotransmitter balance, while also addressing deficiencies common in neurodegenerative conditions. 
					Includes theophylline (~1.4 mg), which aids respiratory and smooth muscle relaxation.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Matcha Powder (700 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Provides L-theanine for calm focus, EGCG for antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, and lutein and vitamin K for cognitive and metabolic support. 
					Contains caffeine (~25 mg) and theophylline (~4.2 mg) for energy without crashes. 
					Its polyphenols improve gut microbiota and metabolic markers, contributing to weight regulation and cognitive enhancement.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Dead Sea Salt (2 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Supplies a well-rounded electrolyte profile, to maintain hydration, nerve signaling, and muscle function.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Cordyceps Mushroom Powder (C. sinensis) (1 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Adenosine, found in the more expensive C. sinensis, boosts ATP production and improves oxygen utilization, for better stamina and respiratory efficiency. The polysaccharides provide antioxidant, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Lion's Mane Powder (1 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Contains hericenones and erinacines that promote BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, supporting neuronal health, memory, and cognitive performance.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Turkey Tail Powder (1 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Rich in polysaccharopeptides that enhance immune modulation and support gut health.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Chaga Powder (1 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Contains antioxidants like melanin and superoxide dismutase that protect against oxidative stress and improve cellular resilience.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Turmeric Powder (700 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Provides curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant, supporting joint health and cellular protection.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Rhodiola Rosea (250 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Adaptogen that reduces stress, enhances mental clarity, and improves energy regulation through salidroside and rosavins.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Ginseng Extract (200 mg, 10% Ginsenosides)</dt>
				<dd>
					Supports physical vitality and cognitive acuity via standardized ginsenosides, which regulate energy and stress.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>CoffeeBerry Extract (200 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Provides polyphenols that boost antioxidant capacity and cognitive health while contributing ~10 mg caffeine for gentle stimulation.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Niacin (Vitamin B3, 75 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Promotes energy metabolism, DNA repair, and circulatory health, while supporting skin integrity.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Green Cardamom (70 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Facilitates digestion and provides antioxidants to support metabolic and gut health.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Clove (60 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Rich in eugenol, delivering potent antioxidant and antimicrobial effects.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			
			<h4>Stimulants</h4>
			<p>
				This blend offers a balanced blend of naturally occurring stimulants from cacao, matcha, and CoffeeBerry. These ingredients provide cognitive and metabolic benefits with better antioxidant effects and without the jitteriness or energy crashes typically associated with pure caffeine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cacao contains theobromine, phenylethylamine (PEA), and anandamide, which collectively improve mood, focus, and neurotransmitter balance. Cacao’s catechins and epicatechins help prolong the effects of these bioactive compounds while offering antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.
			</p>
			<p>
				Matcha is rich in polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), along with L-theanine, which synergistically enhance cognitive focus, mitigates oxidative stress, and reduces inflammation. The antioxidants in matcha also protect against neurodegeneration and support metabolic health.
			</p>
			<p>
				CoffeeBerry provides a gentle caffeine boost complemented by its polyphenols, which enhance cognitive health and antioxidant defenses.
Unlike isolated chemical stimulants, this blend incorporates bioactive compounds that work together to support neurotransmitter function, protect neurons from oxidative damage, improve metabolic health, and promote fat loss.
