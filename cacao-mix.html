            <h2>Cacao Mix</h2>
            <p class="price">Price per serving: $12</p>
            
            <h3>Acute Benefits</h3>
            <p>
            	Within 15 minutes, expect sharper thinking, faster reaction times, and improved verbal fluency. Focus and recall snap into place, while your mood, confidence, and motivation surge. You'll feel mentally unstoppable, ready to tackle challenges and dominate your day. Physically, the warming spices stimulate circulation in brain and body, making it easier to break a sweat and energizing your body for action.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Chronic Benefits</h3>
            <p>
            	Regular use amplifies productivity and performance, making work more enjoyable and workouts more intense. Improved cognitive resilience, memory, and energy levels create a cycle of achievement, fueling long-term success in both mental and physical pursuits. Over time, the motivation and focus this formula inspires become part of your daily rhythm.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Enhancing Pre-Workout Performance</h3>
			<p>
				For optimal results, enjoy the Cacao Mix at least 15 minutes before the Pre-Workout Base. This ensures pre-hydration, supports smooth digestion and nutrient absorption, and primes your body for peak performance. The stimulants enhance focus, motivation, and energy while synergizing with the Base's ingredients to amplify endurance, sustained power, fat oxidation, and muscle pump. Improved gastric emptying further aids metabolic efficiency and workout readiness, contributing to both immediate performance and long-term intestinal and metabolic health.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This sequence enhances workout benefits by supporting sustained power output, greater endurance, and increased fat oxidation during extended sessions. Additionally, the stimulatory effects of the Cacao Mix synergize with the Base's performance enhancers, amplifying readiness and nitric oxide-driven vascular benefits for a more effective workout.
			</p>

			<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<p>
				Heat about 24 oz below-boiling water (to preserve the bioactive compounds). Stir in one serving of the emulsion, whisk or froth until dispersed, and enjoy. The fat base (cacao paste and coconut oil) is built in—no additional fat needed.

			</p>

			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Raw Cacao Paste (6 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Rich in flavonoids (catechins and epicatechins) that improve blood flow, supporting cardiovascular and cognitive function. 
					Contains theobromine (~84 mg) for gentle stimulation, mood enhancement, and vasodilation. 
					Phenylethylamine (~35 mg) and anandamide (~140 μg) contribute to mood elevation and neurotransmitter balance. 
					Includes theophylline (~1.4 mg), which aids respiratory and smooth muscle relaxation.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Unrefined Coconut Oil (5 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Provides medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) that support ketone production and rapid energy. The fat content optimizes absorption of curcuminoids and other fat-soluble bioactive compounds in the formula, promoting staged, prolonged release.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Dead Sea Salt (2 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Supplies a well-rounded electrolyte profile, to maintain hydration, nerve signaling, and muscle function.
				</dd>
				<dt>Lion's Mane (1 g, fruiting body)</dt>
				<dd>
					Contains hericenones that promote nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, supporting neuronal health, memory, and cognitive performance. Beta-glucans (≥25%) provide immune-modulating benefits.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Cordyceps militaris (1 g, fruiting body)</dt>
				<dd>
					C. militaris contains significantly higher levels of cordycepin and adenosine than C. sinensis. These compounds enhance cAMP signaling and ATP production for cellular energy metabolism and oxygen utilization. The polysaccharides provide additional adaptogenic benefits, supporting stress resilience and immune function.
				</dd>

				<dt>Organic Ginger (600 mg powder + 3 mg CO₂ extract)</dt>
				<dd>
					Improves blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, stimulates mitophagy, enhances circulation, protein absorption, and gastrointestinal function. Contains shogaols and zingerone with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. The CO₂ extract provides concentrated bioactives without added bulk.
				</dd>
				<dt>Ceylon Cinnamon (1 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Exhibits anti-hyperglycemic effects, improves blood glucose levels, and reduces inflammation. Lacks coumarin, a hepatotoxin found in other cinnamon types.
				</dd>

				<dt>Sunflower Lecithin (600 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Emulsifier that improves dispersion and bioavailability of fat-soluble compounds. Rich in phosphatidylcholine (an acetylcholine precursor supporting memory and focus) and phosphatidylserine (with documented cognitive benefits). Soy-free and non-GMO.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Ceremonial Grade Matcha (3 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Provides L-theanine for calm focus, EGCG for antioxidant and neuroprotective effects, and lutein and vitamin K for cognitive and metabolic support. 
					Contains caffeine (~75 mg) and theophylline (~12.6 mg) for energy without crashes. 
					Its polyphenols improve gut microbiota and metabolic markers, contributing to weight regulation and cognitive enhancement.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Turmeric Powder (300 mg, Lakadong 7% curcumin)</dt>
				<dd>
					Lakadong turmeric from Meghalaya contains approximately 7% curcumin—several times higher than typical turmeric. Provides potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects supporting joint health and cellular protection. The lower dose compensates for higher potency and strong flavor.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Rhodiola Rosea (250 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Adaptogen that reduces stress, enhances mental clarity, and improves energy regulation through salidroside and rosavins.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Green Cardamom (250 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Facilitates digestion and provides antioxidants to support metabolic and gut health.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Clove CO₂ Extract (0.2–0.5 mg) &amp; Star Anise CO₂ Extract (0.3–0.8 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Concentrated aromatic extracts providing eugenol (clove) and anethole (star anise) for antimicrobial, antioxidant, and flavor-enhancing effects without the bulk of powdered spices.
				</dd>

				<dt>Ginseng Extract (200 mg, 10% Ginsenosides)</dt>
				<dd>
					Supports physical vitality and cognitive acuity via standardized ginsenosides, which regulate energy and stress.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>CoffeeBerry Extract (200 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Provides polyphenols that boost antioxidant capacity and cognitive health while contributing ~10 mg caffeine for gentle stimulation.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<h4>Stimulants</h4>
			<p>
				This blend offers naturally occurring stimulants from cacao, matcha, and CoffeeBerry. These ingredients provide cognitive and metabolic benefits with antioxidant effects and without the jitteriness or energy crashes typically associated with pure caffeine. The combined stimulants are balanced by adaptogenic herbs and beta-glucans.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cacao contains theobromine, phenylethylamine (PEA), and anandamide, which collectively improve mood, focus, and neurotransmitter balance. Cacao's catechins and epicatechins help prolong the effects of these bioactive compounds while offering antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.
			</p>
			<p>
				Matcha is rich in polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), along with L-theanine, which synergistically enhance cognitive focus, mitigates oxidative stress, and reduces inflammation. The antioxidants in matcha also protect against neurodegeneration and support metabolic health.
			</p>
			<p>
				CoffeeBerry provides a gentle caffeine boost complemented by its polyphenols, which enhance cognitive health and antioxidant defenses.
Unlike isolated chemical stimulants, this blend incorporates bioactive compounds that work together to support neurotransmitter function, protect neurons from oxidative damage, improve metabolic health, and promote fat loss.
			</p>
			<p class="warning-box">
				<strong>Important Safety Information:</strong> This formula contains caffeine and thermogenic agents (Grains of Paradise). Individuals with cardiovascular conditions, high blood pressure, anxiety disorders, or those taking medications should consult their healthcare provider before use.
