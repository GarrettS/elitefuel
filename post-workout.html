            <h2>Post-Workout Base</h2>
            <p><strong>Recovery That Matches Your Effort.</strong></p>
            <p>
            	Post-Workout Base is designed to complement the physiological effects of intense exercise, leveraging the post-workout blood flow and vasodilation. This allows for improved delivery of critical nutrients—including whey isolate, BCAAs, antioxidants, and bioactive compounds such as curcuminoids, crocin, and bixin—to both muscle tissue and the brain. These nutrients support glycogen replenishment, muscle repair, and cognitive recovery. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Timing, Dose, Consistency, and Preparation</h3>
			
			<p>
				Immediate post-workout consumption capitalizes on heightened sarcoplasmic (muscle cell) insulin sensitivity for a greater nutrient-partitioning effect. This allows for greater uptake of amino acids and creatine to muscle tissue, maximizing protein and glycogen synthesis, lowering cortisol, inducing satiety, and prompting immediate recovery, to reduce post-workout cravings and minimizing the risk of overeating while increasing thermogenesis (TEF). So, keep some in your car and some at work. This product can be mixed with at least 500 ml water (about 16 oz). Milk, kefir, or other products can be added to suit individual preferences.

			<h3>Acute Effects</h3>
			<p>
				Within minutes after post-exercise consumption, the rapidly-digestable nutrients from the high-quality whey, BCAAs, HMB, berry powders, and creatine are shuttled into muscles, for immediate glycogen resynthesis, muscle protein synthesis, repair, and recovery. You may feel like working out again. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Chronic Effects</h3>
			<p>
				Improved muscle buffering, hydration status, for physical performance. Faster recovery facilitates better stress resilience and allows for more frequent training and higher intensity for increased fitness.
			</p>
			<h3>Add-Ons</h3>
			<p>
				For tailored recovery, CellRecharge enhances mitochondrial health, NeuroFuel:Post supports neurotransmitter synthesis and brain energy, and BiomeBalance optimizes the gut microbiome. These add-ons create a customizable approach for athletes and health enthusiasts aiming for peak performance.

			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>
				This Post-Workout Mix is formulated to optimize physical and cognitive recovery from exercise, supporting cellular and metabolic health. The formula combines generous dosages of proteins, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds that work synergistically to promote muscle protein synthesis, reduce oxidative stress, support mitochondrial function, and enhance nutrient absorption.
			</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Cold-Filtered Whey Protein Isolate (48 g yielding 43 g protein)</dt>
				<dd>
					Superior amino acid profile through cold filtration minimizes protein denaturation, resulting in higher biological value (BV) and protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS). Rich in cysteine, which enhances glutathione production - a crucial antioxidant for combating post-exercise oxidative stress. The 43g protein dosage exceeds the leucine threshold (2.5-3g), augmented by additional BCAA and HMB, needed to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis and prolong thermogenesis (as leucine is a ketogenic amino acid and cannot contribute to gluconeogenesis), particularly beneficial in the post-exercise window. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#france">France; 2021; PMCID: PMC8468473</a>, <a href="#monteyne">Monteyne; 2016; PMCID: PMC5845592</a>, <a href="#clayton">Clayton; 2014; PMID: 25049135</a></cite>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Organic Berry Blend (15 g) (two or more of Acai, Blueberry, Elderberry, Goji, Pomegranate, Maqui, Blackberry, Chokeberry, Black currant, Bilberry)</dt>
				<dd>
					This generous 15 g provides phenolic compounds including flavonoids (anthocyanins, flavonols, flavones, flavanols, flavanones, and isoflavonoids), carotenoids, tannins, and phenolic acids in pharmicologically-relevant effects on oxidative stress and inflammation, which are often the leading causes of diabetes, neurological, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Each component offers benefits of high ORAC for neuroprotective, cardiovascular, and immune support; Goji provides unique peptidoglycans and beta-carotene; Pomegranate enhances nitric oxide production. The polyphenols act as postbiotics, increasing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the gut, supporting microbiome health and intestinal barrier function. The carefully sourced 15g dose provides strong therapeutic levels of bioactive compounds while supporting post-exercise inflammation reduction. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#venturi">Venturi; 2023; PMCID: PMC10142833</a>, <a href="#golovinskaia">Golovinskaia; 2021; PMCID: PMC8271923</a></cite>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Fiber Blend (6 g - Inulin 5g, Glucomannan 1g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Dual-action fiber complex supporting gut health and nutrient absorption. Inulin selectively feeds beneficial bacteria, promoting short-chain fatty acid production. Glucomannan's gel-forming properties slow gastric emptying, improving nutrient absorption and supporting blood glucose regulation.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Creatine Monohydrate (5 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Clinical dosage for maximizing muscle phosphocreatine stores. Supports rapid ATP regeneration during high-intensity exercise, reduces mitochondrial stress, and provides neuroprotective benefits through antioxidant properties. The 5g dose ensures optimal saturation of muscle stores while supporting cognitive function through improved brain energy metabolism.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Electrolyte Blend (5 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					The Post-Workout Electrolyte complex has less Ca and Na (which are excitatory) than Pre-Workout Base, to support rehydration and recovery:
					<ul>
						<li>Sodium Bicarbonate (1 g): Optimal dose for buffering exercise-induced acidosis</li>
						<li>Potassium (719.5 mg total): Supports membrane potential and muscle contraction</li>
						<li>Magnesium (205 mg total as bicarbonate and glycinate): Enhanced bioavailability forms supporting energy metabolism and muscle recovery</li>
						<li>Calcium AKG (250 mg): Supports muscle contraction and bone health</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Sodium-Potassium Pump</h5>
					<p>
						The sodium-potassium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase) maintains the electrochemical gradient across cell membranes, essential for nerve impulse propagation, muscle contraction, and cellular homeostasis. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Post-workout, the pump is active in re-establishing ion balance; thus, both sodium and potassium are important. However, potassium's role becomes more significant for recovery as it is essential for repolarization of the cell membrane, aiding in muscle relaxation and reducing fatigue, glycogen resynthesis, and muscle protein synthesis.
					</p>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Coconut Milk Powder (4 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Provides 2g medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and saturated fat, enhancing absorption of fat-soluble compounds and supporting ketone production and the absorption of curcuminoids, carotenoids, and other bioactive compounds in the formula.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>BCAA Blend (3 g, 4:1:1 Leucine:Isoleucine:Valine)</dt>
				<dd>
					The enhanced leucine ratio (1.6g) complements whey protein's anabolic effects. Leucine activates mTOR signaling, while isoleucine enhances glucose uptake in muscle tissue. Valine competes with tryptophan for blood-brain barrier transport, potentially reducing central fatigue. This specific ratio optimizes the thermic effect of food, supporting metabolic rate elevation post-exercise.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Beta Alanine (2 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Precursor to carnosine, enhancing intramuscular buffering capacity. The 1g dose contributes to daily loading requirements for improving high-intensity exercise performance and reducing fatigue. Taking 4-6 g beta-alanine in divided doses over a month can significantly increase physical performance while reducing paraesthesia (tingling). <cite class="reflink"><a href="#trexler">(Trexler; 2015; PMCID: PMC4501114)</a></cite>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Bioactive Complex (1.6 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>Turmeric (300 mg): Provides curcuminoids and turmerones, enhanced by the presence of phospholipids and coconut fat for improved absorption</li>
						<li>Ginger (300 mg): Contains gingerols and shogaols, supporting circulation and digestion</li>
						<li>Ceylon Cinnamon (700 mg): Supports glucose metabolism and contains unique polyphenols</li>
						<li>Annatto Seed Powder (300 mg): Rich in bixin and norbixin carotenoids, specifically shown to protect against age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts. These compounds filter harmful blue light, protecting retinal health, and may improve night vision. While the 300 mg dose is conservative, chronic use, especially in combination with other carotenoids present in the NeuroFuel:Post add-on, supports long-term neural transmission and rod and cone function in macular health. The antioxidant profile helps protect against DNA damage and supports cellular health.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Natto Powder (1.5 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Natto powder contains Bacillus subtilis, a probiotic bacteria that supports gut health and immunity, and nattokinase, a fibrinolytic enzyme that supports vascular health.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>TMG (Betaine) (1,000 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Supports methylation processes and osmolyte function at the clinically effective 1g dose. Enhances protein synthesis pathways while supporting liver function and homocysteine metabolism.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>HMB (β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate) (1 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					This leucine metabolite enhances muscle protein synthesis while reducing protein breakdown. The 1g dose has been shown to improve recovery, particularly when combined with whey protein. HMB activates the mTOR pathway through a mechanism complementary to leucine, while also promoting muscle stem cell proliferation and differentiation. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#kaczka">Kaczka; 2019; PMCID: PMC6724588</a></cite>
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Astragalus (800 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Adaptogenic herb supporting immune function and cardiovascular health. Contains unique polysaccharides and astragalosides that enhance mitochondrial function and cellular resilience, particularly beneficial during post-exercise recovery.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>AKI Omega 3 DHA Powder (500 mg, yielding 100 mg DHA)</dt>
				<dd>
					Stabilized DHA powder supporting cognitive function and reducing inflammation. The powder form ensures stability and improved bioavailability, while the 100 mg DHA contributes to daily omega-3 needs, particularly important for neural recovery.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Ashwagandha (KSM-66) (250 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Standardized for withanolides, KSM-66 modulates the HPA axis, reducing cortisol and stress response, aiding post-exercise recovery. Its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anxiolytic effects, synergize with phosphatidylserine. Studies typically use 300 mg twice daily, showing it lowers anxiety, blood pressure, and increases DHEA-S and hemoglobin in stressed adults. It has been shown to increase testosterone in men and, in women, to improve hormonal cycle, menopause symptoms, fertility, and sexual health.
				</dd>
			
				<dt>Forskolin (20% extract, 200 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
A natural adenylate cyclase activator that synergistically enhances cAMP signaling alongside cordyceps. This dual pathway activation optimizes cellular energy production and fat metabolism. The 20% standardization provides 40mg of active forskolin, working in concert with the adenosine and cordycepin from cordyceps to amplify metabolic benefits.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Phosphatidylserine (Sharp-PS) (150 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Clinically validated form supporting cognitive function and cortisol regulation. The 150 mg dose has been shown to support exercise recovery, exercise-induced stress and overtraining, and neural membrane function and neurotransmitter signaling. As a phospholipid, PS significantly improves the absorption and bioavailability of carotenoids (including bixin and norbixin from annatto), curcuminoids from turmeric, and other fat-soluble compounds in the formula through enhanced micelle formation and improved cellular uptake. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#kingsley">Kingsley</a></cite>

						</dd>
					
						<dt>Omega-3 DHA Powder (500 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							The additional 100 mg DHA contributes to daily omega-3 needs, synergizes with DHA and triacetyluridine for greater phospholipid synthesis and neural recovery.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>CDP-Choline (300mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Choline and TMG are methyl donors, which help detoxification process, reduce the accumulation of metabolic waste products after intense workouts, and improve post-exercise fatigue and mood.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Cordyceps (Real Mushrooms) (300 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Premium C. sinensis provides adenosine and cordycepin, which work synergistically with forskolin to enhance cAMP signaling and ATP production. This combination optimizes cellular energy metabolism and oxygen utilization. The polysaccharides provide additional adaptogenic benefits, supporting stress resilience and immune function. This conservative dose avoids excess post-workout excitation (overstimulation).
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Bacopa (Cognance®) (300mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Bacopa's anxiolytic effects (via bacosides and other bioactives) promote relaxation, lowering cortisol and inflammation and supporting cognitive recovery after intense workouts.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Phosphatidylserine (Sharp-PS®) (150 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							The additional 150 mg brings the dose to 300 mg for combined synergy with the additional DHA, which confer a dose-dependent response for better cognitive function, stronger neural membrane function and neurotransmitter signaling, and better response to exercise-induced stress and overtraining. This dose further improves the absorption and bioavailability of bioactive compounds in this add-on which synergize with similar compounds in Post-Workout Base. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#starks">Starks</a>, <a href="#kim">Kim</a></cite>
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Rhodiola Rosea (150mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							[Benefit description for Rhodiola Rosea - Needs to be added. An adaptogen known for reducing stress and fatigue and improving cognitive function.]
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Resveratrol (100mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							[Benefit description for Resveratrol - Needs to be added. A polyphenol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, potentially beneficial for cognitive health and longevity.]
						</dd>
					
						<dt>GABA (100mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							[Benefit description for GABA - Needs to be added. A neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve impulses, promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety.]
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Magnesium Glycinate (100mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							[Benefit description for Magnesium Glycinate - Needs to be added. A form of magnesium with high bioavailability, supporting muscle and nerve function, sleep, and stress management.]
						</dd>
					
						<dt>L-Theanine (50 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							GABA modulator that promotes alpha-wave production in the brain. This dose is clinically validated for reducing stress while maintaining alertness.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Saffron (30 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Supports relaxation, recovery, and cognitive repair post-exercise. Saffron and carotenoids work together to improve macular and systemic antioxidant effects, particularly beneficial post-workout.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Triacetyluridine (25 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Improves phospholipid synthesis. Synergistic with DHA, CDP-Choline, and phosphatidylserine. The uridine-DHA synergy is well-established for phospholipid synthesis, benefiting both memory and focus by strengthening cellular membranes.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Pterostilbene (20 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Pterostilbene (20 mg), a stilbenoid, provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support for cognitive health and longevity. It supports mitochondrial function and may protect against age-related neurodegeneration. Synergistic interactions with resveratrol enhance its effects. While doses up to 250 mg/day are generally well-tolerated, higher doses may cause fatigue.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Lutein (20 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Carotenoid that synergistically enhances recovery by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. A 30 mg dose can produce a small, but noticeable change in skin tone, particularly in the palms over time. Clinical evidence shows lutein reduces the risk of AMD and protects against cognitive decline through its antioxidant effects. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#bone">(Bone & Landrum; 2010; PMCID: PMC2957564)</a></cite> When combined with DHA, lutein shows improved bioavailability and synergistic effects in maintaining neural integrity, particularly in aging populations.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Astaxanthin (10 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Astaxanthin, a carotenoid, crosses the blood‑brain barrier and has shown protective effects against neurological disorders, traumatic brain injury, neuronal damage, cognitive impairment and neuropathic pain. As an antioxidant, it promotes muscle recovery and reduces inflammation following physical exertion. Supplementation with 10 mg improves endurance from exercise by reducing muscle fatigue and complements the actions of Rhodiola Rosea in improving stress resilience without causing drowsiness seen at higher doses. Combined with omega-3 fatty acids, astaxanthin further supports brain and cardiovascular health.
						</dd>
					
						<dt>Zeaxanthin (4 mg)</dt>
						<dd>
							Carotenoid that provides potent recovery support by mitigating oxidative damage and supporting cellular repair. Zeaxanthin synergistically enhances the effects of lutein by increasing macular pigment density and filtering harmful blue light. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#juturu">(Juturu; 2016; PMID: 277)</a></cite>
