			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<p>
				Collagen Peptides, Coconut Sugar/Date Sugar, Turkey Tail, Tremella, Reishi, Chaga, Lion’s Mane, Turmeric, Ceylon Cinnamon, Ginger Powder, Cardamom Powder, Saffron, Ashwagandha, Astragalus, Long Pepper, Clove Powder, Nutmeg, L-Theanine.
			</p>
	
			<h3>Benefits</h3>
			<p>
				This Golden Milk formula combines adaptogenic herbs, medicinal mushrooms, bioactive spices, and structural proteins in precisely calibrated amounts to support sleep quality, cognitive function, and systemic wellness. The ingredients work synergistically to enhance bioavailability, reduce inflammation, and promote cellular repair processes.
			</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Collagen Peptides (5 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Hydrolyzed for optimal absorption, these peptides provide essential amino acids glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. The 5 g dose supports connective tissue repair, enhances skin elasticity, and strengthens joint integrity while maintaining optimal flavor balance. Glycine, particularly abundant in collagen, acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter supporting sleep quality while proline supports gut barrier integrity. The formula's bioactive compounds from turmeric and mushrooms may enhance collagen synthesis and cross-linking.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Turmeric (2 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Clinical dose providing curcuminoids and aromatic turmerones. Bioavailability is enhanced through synergistic interaction with long pepper's piperine and ginger's gingerols. Curcumin modulates NF-κB signaling, reducing inflammatory cascades, while turmerones exhibit unique neuroprotective properties. The 2 g dose, combined with absorption enhancers, achieves therapeutic blood levels for supporting joint mobility, cognitive function, and systemic inflammation reduction.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Mushroom Complex</dt>
				<dd>
					Optimized blend of medicinal mushrooms providing complementary benefits:
					<ul>
						<li>Lion's Mane (1 g): Contains hericenones and erinacines that cross the blood-brain barrier, stimulating Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) production. Supports neuroplasticity and cognitive function.</li>
						<li>Turkey Tail (700 mg): Rich in PSK and PSP polysaccharides, supporting immune modulation through β-glucan activity. Enhances gut microbiota diversity and exhibits selective immunomodulatory effects.</li>
						<li>Chaga (600 mg): High in melanin and betulinic acid, providing antioxidant support and DNA protection. Enhances skin barrier function through melanin-mediated photoprotection.</li>
						<li>Reishi (500 mg): Contains triterpenes and beta-glucans that modulate GABA pathways, promoting relaxation and sleep quality. Supports stress resilience through HPA axis modulation.</li>
						<li>Tremella (500 mg): Rich in glucuronoxylomannan, enhancing hyaluronic acid synthesis and skin hydration. Supports moisture retention in neural tissues.</li>
					</ul>
					The 3.3 g mushroom complex provides balanced immunomodulation and neurotropic effects while maintaining optimal palatability.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Spice Complex</dt>
				<dd>
					Bioactive spice blend optimized for therapeutic effects:
					<ul>
						<li>Ceylon Cinnamon (1.4 g): Contains type-A procyanidins and cinnamaldehyde, supporting glucose metabolism and providing antimicrobial benefits. The true Ceylon variety ensures low coumarin content.</li>
						<li>Cardamom (1.2 g): Rich in 1,8-cineole and terpinyl acetate, supporting digestive enzyme production and respiratory function.</li>
						<li>Ginger Powder (1.2 g): Gingerols and shogaols enhance absorption of other compounds while providing independent anti-inflammatory effects through COX-2 inhibition.</li>
						<li>Long Pepper (400 mg): Contains piperine and piperlongumine, crucial for enhancing bioavailability of curcuminoids and other compounds through inhibition of glucuronidation.</li>
						<li>Clove (400 mg): High in eugenol, providing potent antioxidant effects and supporting oral health through selective antimicrobial activity.</li>
						<li>Nutmeg (200 mg): Contains myristicin and macelignan, supporting GABA function and providing mild anxiolytic effects.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Neurotropic Compounds</dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>7,8-DHF (7.5 mg): Potent TrkB agonist mimicking BDNF activity, supporting neuroplasticity and cognitive function.</li>
						<li>L-Theanine (150 mg): Direct GABA modulator promoting alpha-wave production in the brain. This dose is clinically validated for reducing stress while maintaining alertness.</li>
						<li>Bacopa (300 mg): Standardized for bacosides, supporting memory formation and cognitive function through enhanced neurotransmitter function.</li>
						<li>Passionflower (150 mg): Modulates GABA pathways, complementing L-theanine and 7,8-DHF for comprehensive neurological support.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Eye Health Complex</dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>Astaxanthin (2 mg): Powerful carotenoid antioxidant supporting retinal health and blue light protection.</li>
						<li>Annatto Powder (100 mg): Provides bixin and norbixin carotenoids with unique photoprotective properties, specifically filtering high-energy blue light.</li>
						<li>Goji Powder (750 mg): Rich in zeaxanthin and lutein, supporting macular health and visual function.</li>
						<li>Calendula (250 mg): Contains lutein and zeaxanthin, complementing goji's eye health benefits.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Adaptogenic Herbs</dt>
				<dd>
					<ul>
						<li>Ashwagandha (200 mg): Standardized for withanolides, modulating cortisol levels and supporting HPA axis function.</li>
						<li>Astragalus (150 mg): Contains astragalosides and polysaccharides supporting immune function and cardiovascular health.</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Saffron (70 mg)</dt>
				<dd>
					Clinical doses of saffron, 30-100 mg, provide crocins, crocetin, and safranal (fat soluble) which synergistically modulate BDNF expression, reduce neuroinflammation, slow photoreceptor cell degeneration, improve retinal function, and exhibit antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. <cite class="reflink"><a href="#maggi">Maggi</a></cite>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Coconut Sugar/Date Sugar (1.2 g)</dt>
				<dd>
					Minimal amount providing trace minerals including potassium, magnesium, and zinc. Supports palatability while contributing to the formula's mineral profile for optimal enzymatic function. The low glycemic impact is balanced by Ceylon cinnamon's glucose-regulatory effects.
