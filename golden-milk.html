The ingredients work synergistically to enhance bioavailability, reduce inflammation, and promote cellular repair processes.
		</p>
		
		<dl>
			<dt>Collagen Peptides (7 g)</dt>
			<dd>
				Hydrolyzed for optimal absorption, these peptides provide essential amino acids glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. The 7 g therapeutic dose supports connective tissue repair, enhances skin elasticity, and strengthens joint integrity without excessively muting the flavor. Glycine, particularly abundant in collagen, acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter supporting sleep quality while proline supports gut barrier integrity. The formula's bioactive compounds from turmeric and mushrooms may enhance collagen synthesis and cross-linking.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Turmeric (2 g)</dt>
			<dd>
				Clinical dose providing curcuminoids and aromatic turmerones. Bioavailability is enhanced through synergistic interaction with long pepper's piperine and ginger's gingerols. Curcumin modulates NF-κB signaling, reducing inflammatory cascades, while turmerones exhibit unique neuroprotective properties. The 2 g dose, combined with absorption enhancers, achieves therapeutic blood levels for supporting joint mobility, cognitive function, and systemic inflammation reduction.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Mushroom Complex</dt>
			<dd>
				Comprehensive blend of medicinal mushrooms providing complementary benefits:
				<ul>
					<li>Turkey Tail (2 g): Rich in PSK and PSP polysaccharides, supporting immune modulation through β-glucan activity. Enhances gut microbiota diversity and exhibits selective immunomodulatory effects.</li>
					<li>Lion's Mane (1 g): Contains hericenones and erinacines that cross the blood-brain barrier, stimulating Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) production. Supports neuroplasticity and cognitive function.</li>
					<li>Tremella (1 g): Rich in glucuronoxylomannan, enhancing hyaluronic acid synthesis and skin hydration. Supports moisture retention in neural tissues.</li>
					<li>Reishi (1 g): Contains triterpenes and beta-glucans that modulate GABA pathways, promoting relaxation and sleep quality. Supports stress resilience through HPA axis modulation.</li>
					<li>Chaga (1 g): High in melanin and betulinic acid, providing antioxidant support and DNA protection. Enhances skin barrier function through melanin-mediated photoprotection.</li>
				</ul>
				The combined 6 g mushroom complex provides synergistic immunomodulation and neurotropic effects.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Spice Complex</dt>
			<dd>
				Bioactive spice blend optimized for therapeutic effects:
				<ul>
					<li>Ceylon Cinnamon (1.2 g): Contains type-A procyanidins and cinnamaldehyde, supporting glucose metabolism and providing antimicrobial benefits. The true Ceylon variety ensures low coumarin content.</li>
					<li>Ginger Powder (1.2 g): Gingerols and shogaols enhance absorption of other compounds while providing independent anti-inflammatory effects through COX-2 inhibition.</li>
					<li>Cardamom (0.8 g): Rich in 1,8-cineole and terpinyl acetate, supporting digestive enzyme production and respiratory function.</li>
					<li>Long Pepper (0.5 g): Contains piperine and piperlongumine, crucial for enhancing bioavailability of curcuminoids and other compounds through inhibition of glucuronidation.</li>
					<li>Clove (0.4 g): High in eugenol, providing potent antioxidant effects and supporting oral health through selective antimicrobial activity.</li>
					<li>Nutmeg (Pinch): Contains myristicin and macelignan, supporting GABA function and providing mild anxiolytic effects.</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Annatto Seed Powder (500mg)</dt>
			<dd>
				Provides bixin and norbixin carotenoids with unique photoprotective properties. These compounds specifically filter high-energy blue light, protecting retinal cells from oxidative damage. While the 500mg dose is conservative, chronic use supports macular health through enhanced rod and cone function. Synergizes with mushroom antioxidants for comprehensive cellular protection.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Adaptogenic Herbs</dt>
			<dd>
				<ul>
					<li>Ashwagandha (300mg): Standardized for withanolides, modulating cortisol levels and supporting HPA axis function. Enhances stress resilience through regulation of stress hormone cascades.</li>
					<li>Astragalus (200mg): Contains astragalosides and polysaccharides supporting immune function and cardiovascular health through enhanced nitric oxide production and endothelial function.</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Saffron (70mg)</dt>
			<dd>
				Clinical dose of saffron providing crocin and safranal. These compounds exhibit powerful neuroprotective effects through modulation of BDNF expression and reduction of neuroinflammation. Supports mood regulation, sleep quality, and visual function through distinct mechanisms including dopamine modulation and antioxidant effects in retinal tissue.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>L-Theanine (50-100mg)</dt>
			<dd>
				Direct GABA modulator promoting alpha-wave production in the brain. The dose range is clinically validated for reducing stress while maintaining alertness. Synergizes with mushrooms' triterpenes for enhanced relaxation effects without sedation.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Coconut Sugar/Date Sugar (1 g)</dt>
			<dd>
				Minimal amount providing trace minerals including potassium, magnesium, and zinc. Supports palatability while contributing to the formula's mineral profile for optimal enzymatic function. The low glycemic impact is balanced by Ceylon cinnamon's glucose-regulatory effects.
